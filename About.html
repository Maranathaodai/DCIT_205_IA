    <h1>WELCOME</h1>
    <p class="first">
        In the era of Information Technology, 
        Computer Science serves as its fundamental cornerstone. 
        A thorough understanding of computer science is indispensable
        for society to fully leverage the advantages offered by Information Technology 
        and make swift economic progress. The discipline encompasses the exploration and 
        creation of applications that facilitate our daily interaction with computers, 
        the software systems supporting these applications, and the techniques employed in 
        producing applications and systems that exhibit reliable, correct, and ethical behavior. 
        At the core of Computer Science lies the proficiency in computer programming, 
        and employers seeking Computer Scientists anticipate skilled programmers equipped with 
        knowledge of contemporary techniques and tools, along with the ability to apply sound 
        engineering principles to develop, construct, and maintain computer programs.
